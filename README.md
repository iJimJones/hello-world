# hello-world

Greetings visitors,

I am Jim Jones, Professor Emeritus of Computer Science at Graceland University, Lamoni, Iowa, USA.
After my Junior year in high school I attended a computer camp in 1968 at the University of
Missour at Rolla (now known as Missour Science & Technology). We learned to write programs in
a variant of Fortran (Watfor) on an IBM 360 mainframe using punched cards. I attended Rolla for
my B.S. degree in computer science in 1974. I got a masters in computer science from DePaul University
in 1983. I taught computer science courses at Graceland since 1983 until I retired in 2014, getting
my Ph.D. in computer science along the way, in 1997, from the University of Iowa.

In my later years I became most proficient as a C programmer, a Python programmer, and web
developer/programming (HTML5, CSS3, PHP, Perl, Javascript, and WebGL). In retirement I still
maintain and manage several Linux systems and web sites. I occassionally work with college students
on programming contests and projects. I spend a lot of time biking and traveling with my wife.
