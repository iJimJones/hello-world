# hello-world

Greetings visitors,

I am Jim Jones, Professor Emeritus of Computer Science at Graceland University, Lamoni, Iowa, USA.
After my Junior year in high school I attended a computer camp in 1968 at Un of Missouri-Rolla
(now known as Missouri Science & Technology) writing WATFOR programs (a variant of Fortran)
on an IBM 360 mainframe using punched cards and JCL. I attended Rolla and graduated with a B.S. 
in Comp Sci in 1974. While working as a software engineer, trainer, and recruiter in government
service I got my MS in Comp Sci from DePaul Un. in 1983 and begain teaching computer science at
at Graceland University with some sabatical time to finish my Ph.D. in Comp Sci from the Un. of Iowa
in 1997 and embedded systems programming in the telecom industry (1999-2002). I retired in 2014.

Although my skillset was broad I was most profiecient as a C programmer, a Python programmer, and web
developer/programming (HTML5, CSS3, PHP, Perl, Javascript, and WebGL). After almost 10 years into 
retirement I spend less time engaging with college students on their projects and only occassionally
give lecturs. Most of my attention involves digitizing historic records for our town cemetery, including
management of its database and website. Beyond that I spend a lot of time biking and traveling with my wife.
