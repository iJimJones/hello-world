# hello-world

Greetings visitors,

I am Jim Jones, Professor Emeritus of Computer Science at Graceland University, Lamoni, Iowa, USA.
My computing began in 1968 after my junior year of high school attending a computer camp 
at the Un. of MO-Rolla (now Missouri Science & Technology) writing WATFOR programs (a Fortran variant)
on an IBM 360 mainframe using punched cards and JCL. I graduated with a BS in Comp Sci in 1974 from Rolla.
While in government service as a software engineer, trainer, and recruiter I finished my
MS in Comp Sci from DePaul University in 1983 and left to teach computer science at
Graceland University from 1983-2014, with some time off to finish my Ph.D. in Comp Sci from the 
Un. of Iowa in 1997 and embedded systems programming in the telecom industry (1999-2002). 
I retired from Graceland in 2014.

As a teacher my skillset was broad but I was most proficient in C, Python, and web programming
(HTML5, CSS3, PHP, Javascript). After almost 10 years into retirement I have less engagement
with college students on their projects and occassionally give a lecture. My passion has been
digitizing funeral, cemetery, and newspaper archives for our town and managing the cemetery
database and website. Beyond that I spend a lot of time biking and traveling with my wife.
